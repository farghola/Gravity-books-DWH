a Data Warehouse ETL project that utilizes SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services). Through this project, we have been able to create, shape and elevate the data for Gravity Books , enabling us to make more informed strategic decisions and provide better customer experiences.

To ensure that our data is organized and ready for Gravity Books' multifaceted world , we have designed a meticulously crafted Data Warehouse using the Snowflake Schema. With the help of SSIS, we have captured the essence of time by meticulously recording every customer interaction and sale in the Transaction Fact Table , dancing through Slowly Changing Dimensions to shape Gravity Books' story.

Another masterpiece of this project is the Accumulated Snapshot Fact Table , which freezes pivotal moments to provide a panoramic view of crucial business metrics. To ensure the accuracy and harmony of data relationships, we have utilized SSIS's Lookup features.

This project is not just about data, it's an odyssey of innovation. We invite you to embark on the Gravity Books Data Odyssey with us and see the impact of this project firsthand.
